## Guides
The guides were written in markdown and then converted to html and 
pdf versions. 

* HTML - I used an [online converter](https://markdowntohtml.com/).
* PDF - I first used [this node program](https://github.com/mixu/markdown-styles)
to generate a styled version in HTML. Then I opened
the HTML page in Google Chrome and used the "print to PDF" feature to
save the PDF.

## Viewing Guides
The easiest way to view the guides is to view them through GitHub in your
browser by navigating to the markdown file. If there is a PDF version of the 
guide, you can download and view it using any PDF viewer. Otherwise,
you will need to download the folder associated with the guide. The
HTML version of the guide can then be viewed using a browser.

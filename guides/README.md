## Guides
The guides were written in markdown and then converted to html and 
pdf versions. 

* HTML - I used an [online converter](https://markdowntohtml.com/).
* PDF - I first used [this node program](https://github.com/mixu/markdown-styles)
to generate a styled version in HTML. Then I opened
the HTML page in Google Chrome and used the "print to PDF" feature to
save the PDF.

## Viewing Guides
If there is a PDF version of the guide, you can view it using any PDF viewer.
Otherwise, you will need to download the folder associated with the guide. The
HTML version of the guide can then be viewed using a browser. To view the
markdown version of the guide, you will need to use software that can render
markdown.

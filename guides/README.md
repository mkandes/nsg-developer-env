## Guides
The guides were written in markdown and then converted to html and 
pdf versions. 

* HTML - I used an [online converter](https://markdowntohtml.com/).
* PDF - I first used [this node program](https://github.com/mixu/markdown-styles)
to generate a styled version in HTML. Then I opened
the HTML page in Google Chrome and used the "print to PDF" feature to
save the PDF.

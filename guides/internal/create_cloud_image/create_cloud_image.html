<h1 id="create-cloud-image">Create Cloud Image</h1>
<p>There is an Ansible script that will install the dev stack on a Ubuntu machine.
You will need to run the Ansible script, then the cloud-init script to purge
cloud data from the machine. You will need to have Ansible installed on your
local machine to follow this guide.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create an instance on SDSC cloud. You can follow the guide <a href="https://sdsc-ucsd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SC/pages/110034977/Getting+Started+with+Linux+Instances">here</a>.
Make sure that you select &quot;Ubuntu 18.04 LTS x86_64&quot; as your source and have
set up ssh access (keypair, security group and floating ip).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure that you are in create_image/ansible/ and then run the playbook.
This command will take some time to run.</p>
<pre><code> ansible-playbook -<span class="hljs-selector-tag">i</span> -e <span class="hljs-string">'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3'</span> &lt;ip <span class="hljs-selector-tag">address</span> of instance&gt;, -u ubuntu  create_dev_env.yml
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Make sure that you are in create_image/ and run the cloud-init script. Once
you run this command, you will not be able to ssh back into the instance.</p>
<pre><code> cat prepare_for_cloud_init.sh | ssh -l ubuntu &lt;ip address <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">instance</span>&gt; /bin/bash
</code></pre></li>

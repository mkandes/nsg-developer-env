How to Share an Image

This guide will show you how to share an image using the Openstack cli. This 
will involve a two step process:

1. Share the image from the project that owns the image
2. Accept the image share from the project that wants to be able to use the image

Setup
To share an image, you will need the Openstack cli found at https://pypi.org/project/openstacksdk/ and your 
project rc file that can be found using this guide 
https://sdsc-ucsd.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SC/pages/110034947/How+To+Download+the+OpenStack+Project+RC+File .

You can can install the Openstack cli by running
    pip install openstacksdk

Once you have the cli installed, source your project rc file and enter your 
password when prompted:
    source /path/to/project-rc

Sharing an Image

Make sure that you are using credentials for a user in the project that 
owns the image. To share, run the following command, replacing <image id>
with the id of the image that you want to share and <project id> with the id of
the project that you would like to share the image with. 

    openstack image add project <image id> <project id>

Accepting a Shared Image

Make sure that you are using credentials for a user in the project that the
image was shared with. To accept the shared image, run the following command,
replacing <image id> with the id of the image that was shared.

    openstack image set --accept <image id>
